//Pseudo code
//First I will use a console.log command to give a prompt to the user in the console
//Then I will asign 3 combination numbers using different arithmetic
//Then I will add a screen prompt that asks if the user is ready for their combination
//finally I will add an alert screen that provides a string concatenation uncluding the calculated combo numbers

console.log("You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret comboination:");
let combo1 = 5*6;
let combo2 = 70/7;
let combo3 = 15+14;
prompt ("are you ready for your combination?");
alert("here is the numbers for your combination " + combo1 + " " + combo2 + " " + combo3 );
